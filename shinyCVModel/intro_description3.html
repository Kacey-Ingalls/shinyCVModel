<em>“Think it’s going to be there tomorrow... The thing you’ve got to think is: If it hits us, we’re going to stop it. You have to think that way. I keep hearing, ‘Oh, if it hits us we just have to accept it and it’s going to spread.’ Why? You’ve lost before you’ve started.” -- Bruce Aylward, WHO, Feb 25, 2020</em>

<p>The models provided here are "interactive" tools.</p>

<p>Each question in the sidebar is answered with an interactive model. Feel free to change the parameters provided for each model to observe the impact those changes make on the answers to the
  question.  These are not 'canned' pre-run simulations, but they are actual models that run in real-time as you change parameter values.  So be patient, as you wait for the simulation results to show up on the screen.</p>
