<em>We need to look forward, ahead of the curve in Washington State...<br>
If you do that math, it gets very disturbing. -- Governor Jay Inslee, 3/10/2020</em>

<p>An epidemiological model may be used to investigate the potential impact of policy decisions aimed at curbing the spread and impact of infectious agents, such as the novel 2019 coronavirus.</p>

<p>While all models are imperfect and are based on various data and assumptions, the results of model simulations may help policy makers better understand the consequences of their decisions.  The results for different simulated policy options may also be compared to help identify optimal solutions that protect public health.</p>

<p>For example: one might simulate a model to explore the impact of various magnitudes and timings for social distancing strategies on the course of disease transmission within a community.</p>

<p><strong>This is not an official government website.</strong><br>As far as I'm aware, none of my coronavirus modeling work is actually guiding any real-world government decision-making. The analyses here
  only represent my perspective. Results from other models should be considered for decision-making.
I fully recognize that disease control decisions need to consider many factors, not
only health outcomes, but the overall wellness of the public.</p>
